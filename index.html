                        José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines. The seventh of eleven children, he came from a well-educated and affluent family. Rizal's parents, Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonzo, instilled in him a passion for learning. He excelled academically, completing his early education in Calamba and Biñan before attending Ateneo Municipal de Manila and later the University of Santo Tomas, where he studied medicine and philosophy.

                    <p>
                        In 1882, Rizal traveled to Madrid to continue his medical studies at Universidad Central de Madrid. He earned his Licentiate in Medicine in 1884 and a degree in Philosophy the following year. Rizal further honed his skills in ophthalmology in Paris and Heidelberg. His experiences in Europe exposed him to liberal ideals and the injustices of Spanish colonial rule, inspiring him to work toward Filipino independence and reform through literature, activism, and scholarship.

                    <p>
                        Rizal's most significant works, Noli Me Tangere (1887) and El Filibusterismo (1891), are widely regarded as catalysts for Philippine independence. These novels highlighted the abuses and corruption of Spanish authorities and clergy in the Philippines. Written in Spanish, these works awakened the national consciousness of Filipinos and earned Rizal both acclaim and the ire of the Spanish government. His literary prowess solidified his role as a leading intellectual and reform advocate.

                        Beyond his literary works, Rizal actively promoted peaceful reform. He co-founded the La Liga Filipina in 1892, an organization that sought social and political reforms through unity and civic engagement. Despite his nonviolent approach, his actions were perceived as a threat by Spanish authorities. Rizal was arrested and exiled to Dapitan, where he continued his work as a physician, teacher, and farmer while helping improve the community’s living conditions.

                        In 1896, Rizal was implicated in the Philippine Revolution despite his opposition to violence. He was convicted of sedition and executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896, at Bagumbayan (now Luneta Park). Rizal’s martyrdom transformed him into a national hero, inspiring Filipinos to continue the fight for freedom. His final poem, Mi Último Adiós, written before his execution, remains a testament to his unwavering love for his country and his enduring legacy.

                        Today, José Rizal is revered as the Philippines’ national hero. His works are studied in schools, and his life serves as a model of patriotism and selfless service. Rizal’s ideas of reform, education, and social justice continue to resonate, reminding Filipinos of the power of knowledge and the importance of fighting for equality and freedom. Monuments, parks, and institutions worldwide honor his memory, cementing his place in history as a global icon of change.
